<!-- ABOUT THE LAB -->
## About The Lab

This lab focuses on setting up the necessary environment for AI and data science tasks, followed by a simple python exercise. You'll start by setting up a UV environment, installing essential Python libraries, and setting up Visual Studio Code with Jupyter Notebook for development.


## Part 0: Choice of IDE

We will focus on using Visual studio code during this course.
You are free to use another IDE, just be aware that the TA's may not be able to help you debug eventual issues with your setup.


### 1. Download Visual Studio Code

Download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


### 2. Install the Python Extension
Install the official Python extension for Visual Studio Code.


### 3. Install the Jupyter Extension
Install the Jupyter extension for Visual Studio Code from the "Extensions" menu on the left.


## Part 1: Environment Setup

### 1. Download and Install UV

UV is a fast Python package and project manager. Follow the instructions at [UV documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to download and install UV.

[UV install documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

For most systems, you can install UV using:
**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Alternatively use Homebrew
brew install uv
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Test if UV was installed correctly by typing in your CLI or terminal:
```bash
uv --version
```


### 2. Create a New UV Project

**Open a new terminal in VS code, move into the Lab0 folder *(double check this!)* and initialize the UV project:**
```bash
cd Lab0
uv init
```


*Please make sure you are in the right folder!*

This will create a `pyproject.toml` file and a `.venv` folder containing your virtual environment for the project. The `pyproject.toml` file manages your project's dependencies and settings, while the `.venv` folder contains the isolated Python environment with all installed packages. You can select this environment as your Python interpreter in your notebook.

**Note:** Creating separate environments for different projects/labs keeps everything organized and prevents dependency problems. It makes sure that changes in one project won't create issues in another, which will make your work easier to manage and debug. 


### 3. Install Python Packages

In order to use notebooks using uv you must install: jupyter notebook and ipykernel using the following command:

```bash 
uv add jupyter ipykernel
```


### 4. Create a New Jupyter Notebook
Create a new Jupyter Notebook by creating a file with a .ipynb extension (e.g., make a new file and call it lab0.ipynb).



### 5. Open the Notebook in VSCode
Open the notebook file in Visual Studio Code and select the UV environment Python interpreter in the top right.

Can't find the environment? Have a look at the [troubleshooting helper](Lab0/uv-troubleshooting.md). 

## Part 2: Python Exercises

### Task 1: "Hello World!"

Write and run a Python program that prints `Hello World!`.

1. Create a new Python file or open a Jupyter Notebook.
2. Write a program that outputs the text `'Hello World!'` to the console.
3. Run the program/cell to ensure it executes correctly.

### Task 2: Basic Arithmetic

Perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.

1. Write code to:
   - Add two numbers.
   - Multiply two numbers.
   - Divide one number by another.
2. Display the results of each calculation.

### Task 3: Variables

Learn to store and use values in variables.

1. Create variables to store a name and an age.
2. Print the values of the variables in a formatted string.

### Task 4: Simple loops

Use a loop to repeat an action multiple times.

1. Write a for-loop that iterates over a range of numbers.
2. In each iteration, print a line of text that includes the current iteration number.

### Task 5: Conditional Statements

Implement decision-making in your code using if-else statements.

1. Write an if-statement that checks if a number is greater than 5.
2. Print a message based on whether the condition is true or false.

### Task 6: Match-Case Statements(requires Python 3.10+)

Learn to use Python's modern match-case syntax for pattern matching (Python 3.10+).

1. Create a variable that stores a day of the week (as a string, e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.).
2. Use a match-case statement to:
   - Print "Start of the work week!" for Monday
   - Print "Midweek already!" for Wednesday
   - Print "Almost weekend!" for Friday
   - Print "Weekend time!" for Saturday or Sunday
   - Print "Just another day" for any other day
3. Test your code with different day values.

**Bonus:** Extend the match-case to handle both uppercase and lowercase input (e.g., "monday" and "Monday").

## Additional information

#### 1. **Why Use UV?**
   - **UV** is significantly faster than conda and pip for package installation and environment management.
   - It provides better dependency resolution and handles Python version management automatically.
   - UV creates isolated environments by default, preventing dependency conflicts.

#### 2. **Verifying UV Installation**
   - After installing, verify that UV is installed correctly by typing `uv --version` in your terminal. If the command is not recognized, restart your terminal or check your PATH settings.

#### 3. **Managing Project Dependencies**
   - UV uses `pyproject.toml` files to manage dependencies, which is the modern Python standard.
   - Use `uv add package_name` to add dependencies and `uv remove package_name` to remove them.

#### 4. **Python Version Management**
   - UV can automatically install and manage Python versions. Use `uv python install 3.11` to install Python 3.11.
   - Projects can specify their Python version requirements in `pyproject.toml`.

#### 5. **Lockfiles for Reproducibility**
   - UV generates `uv.lock` files that ensure reproducible installations across different systems.
   - Always commit both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` to version control.

#### 6. **Interpreter Selection in VS Code**
   - After opening a Jupyter Notebook in VS Code, ensure you select the correct Python interpreter from the UV environment in the top right corner to avoid import errors.
   - The interpreter path will typically be in `.venv/bin/python` or `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (Windows).
